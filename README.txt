Operation Method:

Follow the instructions provided in the command line interface to complete the calculation tasks.

Installation and Execution:

PySTH is an online application, requiring no installation. You can run it directly for use.

This is a program that can quickly calculate the Solar-to-Hydrogen (STH) efficiency and is also capable of plotting the STH efficiency analysis map.

Parameter Description:
CBM (Conduction Band Minimum)
Meaning: The conduction band minimum. It represents the lowest energy level of the conduction band in a photocatalyst semiconductor and affects the electron reduction ability.
Unit: Electron volts (eV).
Purpose: Used to determine whether the conduction band can drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

VBM (Valence Band Maximum)
Meaning: The valence band maximum. It represents the highest energy level of the valence band in a photocatalyst semiconductor and affects the hole oxidation ability.
Unit: Electron volts (eV).
Purpose: Used to determine whether the valence band can drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

xh (Hydrogen Evolution Overpotential)
Meaning: The hydrogen evolution overpotential. It represents the additional energy required for hydrogen generation during the water-splitting reaction (i.e., the difficulty of the reaction).
Unit: Electron volts (eV).

xo (Oxygen Evolution Overpotential)
Meaning: The oxygen evolution overpotential. It represents the additional energy required for oxygen generation during the water-splitting reaction.
Unit: Electron volts (eV).

¦¤¦µ (Vacuum Energy Level Difference)
Meaning: The vacuum energy level difference, an intrinsic property of the photocatalyst material, which affects light absorption and charge carrier driving capability.
Unit: Electron volts (eV).

¦Çcu: Carrier Transport Efficiency
Represents the efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pair transport within the photocatalyst.

¦Çabs: Light Absorption Efficiency
Indicates the ability of the photocatalyst to absorb sunlight, which is typically related to the material's bandgap.

¦ÇSTH: Solar-to-Hydrogen Efficiency
Characterizes the overall efficiency of the photocatalyst in converting solar energy into hydrogen energy, which is the ultimate target parameter.
